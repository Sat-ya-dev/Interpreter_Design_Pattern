## Introduction
The Interpreter design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a way to interpret and evaluate language grammar or expressions. It provides a mechanism to evaluate sentences in a language by representing their grammar as a set of classes.
This report highlights the implementation of the Interpreter Design Pattern in the given C# code, which processes expressions to modify a string based on specified commands.

## Components of Interpreter Design Pattern
The implementation of the Interpreter Design Pattern involves several key components, each playing a specific role in the interpretation process. Below are the main components:
### Context
The Context class stores global information about the input expression and the value that will be manipulated. It holds the expression to be interpreted and the value that will be modified by the expressions.
### Abstract Expression
This interface defines the interpretation method that the subclasses should implement. This method takes the context object as a parameter. This context object holds the data that we want to interpret. In our example, it is the IExpression Interface.
### Concrete Expression
Concrete expressions implement the IExpression interface and define the behavior for each specific command. In this project, classes like LowerCaseExpression, UpperCaseExpression and ReverseExpression fall under this category and are used to modify the value in the context object based on specific rules.
### Interpreter
The Interpreter class is responsible for interpreting the entire expression string. It breaks down the expression into commands, creates the appropriate concrete expression objects, and applies them to the context's value.

## Advantages
Extensibility: New expressions can be easily added without modifying existing code, promoting the Open/Closed Principle.
Reusability: The expressions are modular and reusable across different contexts and projects.
Clarity: The pattern provides a clear structure for interpreting complex expressions, improving code readability.

## Conclusion
The Interpreter Design Pattern is an effective way to design a system that needs to evaluate sentences or commands in a defined language. This implementation provides a clean and extensible structure for interpreting string transformations based on input commands. By breaking down the interpretation process into well-defined components, the pattern enhances maintainability and flexibility, making it a robust solution for similar use cases.
